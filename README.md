HyperMod replaces a couple colors that I personally find to be a tad more appealing, the background, foreground, black color, yellow color, and selection background color come from the iTerm2 color scheme Argonaut:

The Hyper colors come directly from hyper settings file

In the images some personal info has been removed (PC owner) but still shows the green color

How to Install Hyper and HyperMod Themes:
Open Windows terminal -> drop down arrow in the tab bar -> Settings -> 
	Bottom left, click open JSON File -> Scroll down to schemes and copy and past the contents of the json files into the settings.json file ->
	Return to the terminal app go to color schemes (or a profile if you have a specific profile you use) and they should now show up in the drop down!

Looks amazing with the Acryllic and 75% opacity background (My personal Favorite)!

Hope you enjoy!
